title: KubeVirt Roadmap
---

KubeVirt has implemented [Virtualization Enhancement Proposals (VEPs)](https://github.com/kubevirt/enhancements) in order to agree upon implementation details of large feature work and track the feature lifecycle.

You can view the current [KubeVirt Enhancements Tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/kubevirt/projects/18) to get an idea on the list of currently open VEPs, their state, and whether they have been prioritised by the community for the next release. You are also welcome and encouraged to add to the discussion on these proposals, and to express support for VEPs that you would like to see prioritised.

When a VEP is prioritised for the next release, the KubeVirt community is signifying that the owning SIG will ensure there is support for reviewing and the shepherding of the feature for the assigned release. There is still the possibility that the author will not complete the feature PR before code freeze or other unexpected circumstances could delay the feature.

For a list of PRs that have been merged and can be expected in the next release, please see our list of [noteworthy changes for the next KubeVirt release](https://github.com/kubevirt/sig-release/blob/main/upcoming-changes.md) page. These can be considered our 'pre-release notes' and are updated daily.
